Prometheus
==========

[Prometheus](http://pro.me-the.us) (also called Fire) is a C# coded interpreter that supports object-oriented features with [first-class functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_functions). Prometheus objects are event-driven entity models that implement both the singular model and the model collection. 

Prometheus was created for searching, categorizing and extracting data from text based data models. Such as text documents, blogs, RSS feeds and databases.
