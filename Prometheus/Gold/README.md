#GOLD Engine

Install the GOLD Parser engine here. The Visual Studio project files need to exeecute the `GOLDbuild.exe` and `GOLDprog.exe` executable files to recompile the language syntax.

You don't need GOLD to recompile Prometheus. The project includes compiled syntax files from the GOLD engine, but if you want to change the syntax you'll need the GOLD engine. To disable GOLD remove the pre-build options from the Prometheus project settings.

You can download GOLD from here: [http://goldparser.org/download.htm](http://goldparser.org/download.htm)

You can place the contents of the GOLD Builder files directly into the GOLD folder of the project. Here is a direct link to the latest version compatible with Prometheus. [http://goldparser.org/builder/files/GOLD-Builder-5.2.0-Cmd.zip](http://goldparser.org/builder/files/GOLD-Builder-5.2.0-Cmd.zip)
