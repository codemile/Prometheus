#GOLD Engine

Install the GOLD Parser engine here. The Visual Studio project files need to exeecute the `GOLDbuild.exe` and `GOLDprog.exe` executable files to recompile the language syntax.

You don't need GOLD to recompile Prometheus. The project includes compiled syntax files from the GOLD engine, but if you want to change the syntax you'll need the GOLD engine.

You can download GOLD from here: [http://goldparser.org/download.htm](http://goldparser.org/download.htm)
